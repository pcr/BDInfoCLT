BDInfo Command Line Toolkit
======

The main program is from BDInfo Project.
I Modified it to run in Windows's Command Line or Linux Shell with Mono.

Now, support BDMV folder & BDDisk ISO. 

I plan to improve the command param and help for more function, 
but the work is very busy, so the update will not be very regular.

The BDInfo tool was designed to collect video and audio technical specifications from Blu-ray movie discs, including:

<ul>
<li>Disc Size</li>
<li>Playlist File Contents</li>
<li>Stream Codec and Bitrate Details</li>
</ul>

<li>Windows 7 or higher Operating System</li>
<li>Blu-ray BD-ROM Drive</li>
<li>.NET Framework 4.7.2 or Higher</li>
<li>Source Code</li>
</ul>

The BDInfo source code is licensed under the LGPL 2.1.<br>
The free tool <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-csharp-express">Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Express</a> can be used to build the source code.


Known Issues

Occasionally inaccurate bit-depth measurement on Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master audio streams.<br>
BDInfo will *NOT* function correctly with copy-protected discs. You will have to decrypt commercial Blu-ray movie discs before you will be able to gather any info.
